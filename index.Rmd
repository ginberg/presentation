## Introduction to Old Failthful

Old Faithful is a cone geyser located in Wyoming, in Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Old Faithful was named in 1870 during the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to receive a name. It is one of the most predictable geographical features on Earth, erupting almost every 63 minutes. The geyser, as well as the nearby Old Faithful Inn, is part of the Old Faithful Historic District.

## Data set

The chosen dataset contains the waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser.
It is stored as a data frame with 272 observations on 2 variables.

* eruptions  numeric  Eruption time in mins
* waiting    numeric  Waiting time to next eruption

```{r}
summary(faithful$eruptions)
summary(faithful$waiting)
```

## Scatter plot waiting time vs eruption duration

```{r echo=FALSE}
duration = faithful$eruptions      # the eruption durations 
waiting = faithful$waiting         # the waiting interval
plot(waiting, duration,            # plot the variables 
  ylab="Eruption duration (min)",        # y−axis label 
  xlab="Time waited (min)")              # x−axis label
reg1 <- lm(waiting~duration)
abline(reg1, col="red")
```

## Eruption duration

```{r echo=FALSE}
  duration = faithful$eruptions   # the eruption durations 
  waiting = faithful$waiting      # the waiting interval
  number_of_bins = 25
  bins_duration <- seq(min(duration), max(duration), length.out = number_of_bins)
  
  # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
  hist(duration, breaks = bins_duration, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white', ylab="Frequency", xlab="Eruption duration (min)")
```
